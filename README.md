This container is built using official rabbitmq as base and adding:
- [rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange) plugin.
- rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange plugin.
- rabbitmq_management plugin.

**This plugin is [experimental](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange#plugin-status), use at your own risk.**
